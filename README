Instructions for Playing the conway game of life are found here.


The game is basically a simulation following a set of rules on a 32x32 size square grid.

Each cell in the grid has two states, either alive or dead. 1 for alive and 0 for dead.

As time evolves, the square grid is updated based on the current state according to following rules.
-- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation
-- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding
-- Any live cell with two or three neighbours live on to the next generation
-- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell
